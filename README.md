# KotlinCodeJourney

This is just a little space where I'm messing around with Kotlin and trying to crack some LeetCode puzzles along the way. Not here to show off big, fancy code‚Äîjust sharing my small wins, learnings, and (let‚Äôs be honest) the stumbles I make while getting to know Kotlin a bit better.

## What‚Äôs Inside? üì¶

- **LeetCode Fun**: A bunch of LeetCode solutions, written as I wrangle through them in Kotlin.
- **Kotlin Play**: Small experiments, codes, and notes as I muddle my way through learning Kotlin.

## LeetCode-Solutions

In here, I'm sharing the solutions (or attempts at solutions) for problems over at LeetCode, all written in Kotlin because why not? We‚Äôve got:

## Kotlin-Learnings

This part is just a collection of random thoughts, mini-projects, or tiny victories while getting my hands dirty with Kotlin. May include:
- Neat Kotlin tricks (or traps!).
- Moments of ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù and ‚ÄúOh no...‚Äù in more or less equal measure.


**Happy Coding!** üöÄüéâ
